# So here are the steps I'd like to take to get the wallet app up to speed with where we are with our TDD journey

1. Design the User Flow of the app ==> Use Figma or Just Clone an app
                                       and figure out the user flow
                                       from there.

2. Then [rougly] map the architecture of the app from Remote & Local Data Sources
3. Then map those to Repositories and repository implementations and then map the entities as well as the use cases out from here.
4. Then code the entities usecases and repose, then go down all the way and up.

All in All the moral here is to plan out the architecture of the app from the get-go that's what separates the ENGINEERS from the Programmers, there's levels to it, so let's start with app design in Figma enjoy ourselves there get that done.

So what we're focusing on is the Design / user flow, don't spend TOO much time on design but get better
