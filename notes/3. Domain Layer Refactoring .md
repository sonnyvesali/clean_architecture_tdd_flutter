# Overview

So not a lot actually changed from the past time we implemented
a lot of the core practices haven't changed but we'll go through the changes anyways and we added random number functionality and tested it at the domain layer through mocking the repository layer, b/c we'll be moving to the dat layer & model layer later

First we made the classes callable and got in that practice so instead of:
    usecase.call(Params(number: number))
we changed it to:
    usecase(Params(number: number));

b/c they do the same thing [callable classes is just syntactic sugar] for calling the call method

We then wrote up the test with a lot of the same things in mind as the past test for verbosity let's go through the imports again

1. usecases ==> Get the usecase Interface
2. Repository ==> Get the repository that dispenses data to the domain
3. entity ==> Get the type from the domain
4. UseCase ==> Get the RandomNumber use case we're going to test
5. Dartz ==> Function Programming Types
6. Mockito Annotations ==> Annotations for Mock Codegen
6. Flutter Test ==> Access to functions like expect, verify, etc.
7. Mockito General ===> Functions to setup mocks and simulate returned values
8. Random Number Mock ==> Codegen Mock class we'll be using

Then we declare a shell mock repository that implements
the methods of the Abstract Repository class which extends mock functionality as well

Then we use the generate mocks decorator and then include the above repository in it's array

then we declare our main function which we declare the repository and the usecase typing WITH
the late keyword b/c these vars will be assigned in the setUp function as it will be determined
at run time not compile time. then we assign them in the setUp variable

WE then also setUp the NumberTrivia type with some dummy data and then we test.

We do alot of the same things and the setup with the when statement is identical except there
are no params to fill in on the getRandomNumberTrivia function, but we decide what the 'random' mock returns which is some dummy data.

We them define the final result and call the 'call' function in the useCase class through the callable
class syntax and since there are no pararms.

And in the useCase we extend equatable  and essentially have an empty props getter b/c no state is being watched and we just extend that and we have something to fill it in b/c there are no params in the getRandomNumberTrivia app

And then we go through the tests b/c the end results are identical in both cases, let's move on, we are now done with the domain layer, time for the data layer.
