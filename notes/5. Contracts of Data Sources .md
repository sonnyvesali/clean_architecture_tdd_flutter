# Let's do this right now my brain feels a little bit fried

The Repository is the brain of the data layer it decides:
    1. What to do if there is no connection
    2. How to handle different Errors gracefully
    3. Data Caching Policy ,etc. etc.

In the previous piece we outlined the basic structure of the data
layer but now ti's time to implement the data layer itself from the core,
the NumberTrivia repository while creating contracts for its dependencies.

## Implementing the Contract

the important thing is that we must have a contract [interface] that the repository
implementation must fulfill. This way the Use Cases communicating with the repository
don't have to know how it operates.

A skeleton implementation is then drawn out of these classes, basically

the implementation is essentially the abstract repository implemented with the 2 methods that were on the original repository, that is:
    1. GetConcreteNumberTrivia
    2. getRandomNumberTrivia

In order to implement them you override the default implementation in the abstract class and return null for now.

## Repo Contracts

Next we will create the contracts for the repository dependencies to mock them w/out needing to implement them

Dependencies:
    A. Network Info ==> Once again skeleton
    B. Exceptions ===> Skeleton Classes for ServerFailures & CacheFailures

Local Data Sources:
    - NumberTriviaLocalDataSource implement the method signatures for
      getLastNumberTrivia() and cacheNumberTrivia

Go back to the tests and add the following and instantiate them:
    1. NumberTriviaRempostiroyImpl
    2. MockRemoteDataSource
    3. MockLocalDataSource
    4. MockNetworkInfo

Then add them to the implementation file and instantiate those pieces as well

Ok let's do something... Let's go back to the wallet application we've learned a lot let's architect a wallet application :)
