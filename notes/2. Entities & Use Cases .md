Error #1: "The argument type 'Null*' cannot be assigned to parameter type int"

Solution:

Error #2: The return type 'Right<dynamic, NumberTrivia*>*' isn't a 'Future<Either<Failure, NumberTrivia>>', as required by the closure's

Solution
===========================================================

Start Inner & Move Outward from there

Refresher:
    Entities ===> UseCases ===> Controllers / Presenters / Gateways =====> Devices / DB / External interfaces / Web / UI

So We started w/ the Entity which was in the Domain b/c that's where the business logic lays so the order is like this
    1. Entity =================> Understand the shape of the data that the UI would consume.
    2. Use Cases ==============> This is where the core business logic gets executed
    3. Repository Contract ====> This is the Data Source consumer middleware
                                  or the dependency inversion layer

So we're using Equatable along with Bloc and that we'll use equatable.

So in the file 'features/number_trivia/domain/entities/number_trivia.dart'

Where we describe a basic entity for the text and number WITH props
so bloc will be able to monitor the state of prev and present [in.our.case]
text and numbers, and that props decide what fields get considered for object
comparison down the line

We then move on to the use cases where we do the following:
        1. Define a Failure Type to have Error handling handled
            functionally instead of in try / catch blocks.
        2. Then use that failure type in the repository contract
            which you can think of as the 'terms of returned data'
            where there were terms for the 2 usecases and they get
            defined in the same file, where types are the same for
            what gets passed but the params are different based on
            the get function that was called, observe:
Future<Either<Failure, NumberTrivia>> getNumberQuery(int number);
Future<Either<Failure, NumberTrivia>> getRandomNumber();

After defining the types you now can write the tests for the usecases
b/c remember TDD starts with RED GREEN REFACTOR.

So we start with a failing test right, but step 0 start with imports:

Since we already know the answer let's do it progressive about the
minimal dependencies that would be necessary for this implementation

First import the following from your project. Your Feature :
    1. Repository
    2. Entity
    3. UseCase(s)

Also Externally Speaking:
    1. Mockito/Mockito.dart ===> Core Mock Implementation
    2. Mokito/Annotations.dart ==> CodeGen

==================================
Then you'll want to implement an empty mockRepository implementation
which you can do pretty simply by extending mock and implementing the
core repository

Then you want to type your main function that will have your tests
but add the GenerateMocks decorator with parentheses and an array that
includes the mock class for codegen.

and then write the test in our case we decalre 2 variables:
    1. The GetConcreteNumberMethod [from.the.repo] and we'll call it useCase
    2. Then the Mock [which.will.have.an.extra.mock.in.front.of.it]
      and we'll call it mockNumberTriviaRepository

    Then in setup we instantiate everything first we instantiate the 
    Repository through the call syntax Mock(), and then pass that 
    into the useCase.

    Just so you understand the roundabout: GetcontreteNumberTrivia is
    a class that implements a constructor that takes a type of a 
    repository [an abstract class] that has 2 method signitures
    but the same return type of a Promise wrapped Option of fail or
    NumberTrivia, and numberTrivia is the type defined in the entity

    3. Then in setup we're supposedly supposed to instnatiate these
        but it doesn't work so we end up doing it in th test scope 
        and that works fine, so do it in scope fucking whatever.
        and then we now get into the actual test now.

      |===============|  
      | THE DAY AFTER | : I GOTS THE REASON:
      |===============|
|===============================================================================|
|      If you're ever looking at an old codebase and it's not working           |
|     when you try to recreate it, think about the following if it is           |
|     an error that has to do with something null, it probably has to do        |
|     with not leveraging proper tooling in our case, the problem was           |
|     that the variables were being assigned to null b/c you didn't let         |
|     the compiler know that the 2 vars would be initialized later and          |
|     since it didn't know it threw the run time error which in our             |
|     case was ameliorated by adding that word, so think about null             |
|     safety and as you get more familiar you will get better at tackling       |
|     these sorts of issues but that's the reason the SetUp wasn't working      |
|     it was assigned null and the classes were un-initialized.                 |================================================================================|

    So when getConcreteNumberTrivia is called with any agrument,
    always answer with the right side of either containing a test
    Number Trivia object

    Then You call the [not yet existant] execute method that 
    well executes the business logic on the values from the data
    source

    Then you verify that the value returned was equivalent, 
    Verify that the method has been called on the Repo
    and that no more meothds should have been called

We then go back to our usecases and write logic to make these tests
pass: notice we're describing behaviors in a testable manner where
it's clearly described, ik it's a lil unnatural but it's good practice
anyways.

And then in the actual usecase file we import:

1. Darts ==> Functional Goodies
2. Equatable ==> Value Equality Comparisons
3. Failures ==> Get the failure type
4. useCase ==> Generic UseCase Type that returns Promise wrapped Option
5. NumberTrivia ==> Get the NumberTrivia Entity w/ Text & Number
6. NumTriviaRepo ==> Get the terms of return from data sources

So with those imports in mind we declare a class that implements the UseCase Future Wrapped Option with the Left & Right options being the NumberTrivia and the Params option which defines what data and state gets passed into the call function.

We then declare a repo varialbe and instantiate the class with that repo type.

Then we override the call metehod defined the abstract UseCase class [that is just a signiture] and implement it by returning the
repository getConcreteNumber method and the params are defined in a class below it.

so that was very roundabout but that's the nature of learning software architecuter
