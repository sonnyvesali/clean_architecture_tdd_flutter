# The Theory of it all

The Clean Architecture model

                        |------------------------------------|                        
                        |    4. Devices, Web, UI, External   |
                        |         Interfaces, Database       |
                        |   |----------------------------|   |
                        |   |      3. Controllers        |   |
                        |   |   |--------------------|   |   |
                        |   |   |  2.  Use Cases     |   |   |
                        |   |   |   |------------|   |   |   |
                        |   |   |   |1. Entities |   |   |   |
                        |   |   |   |------------|   |   |   |
                        |   |   |--------------------|   |   |
                        |   |----------------------------|   |
                        |------------------------------------|

Let's start here with this model alright, think of this as an onion where each layer you work on
has outter layers that depend on it, for example entities [shape of the data] doesn't depend
on anything else but the use cases [ie application of data] depends on the shape of the data,
and executes logic based on the entities, then the controllers depend on the Use Cases Logic
to then tell the UI and everything the user sees how to change.

The simple principle behind this is, when you separate things out it makes it much easier to
maintain add new features and iterate quickly b/c imagine you build a wallet app for example
and all this business logic and your UI is inextricably tied together and you can't write or
alter anything or iterate quickly simply b/c it's spaghetti everything is tied together and
nothing is modularized.

This trifurcation layering should be used with each 'feature' of the application where each
feature has the following abstraction layers:
    1. Presentation
    2. Domain
    3. Data

1. Note most of the business logic happens at the use cases layer, at most the presentation layer
   would handle basic input conversion and validation.

2. Now the domain layer shoudn't be suceptible to the whims of changing data sources or porting the app
   to angular dart. It will only contain core business logic [use cases] and business objects
   [data shape] entities / models. It should be completely independent of every other layer.
   The data cleaning should happen at other layers so this should only change if the DATA your
   app uses changes substantially.

But hold on sonny how can Domain be independent when Domain gets its data from a repository which is the
data and data cleaning layer? ==> Think of repository as a bridge abstraction that belongs to both layers
with dependency inversion.

===================================================================================================
Side Quest ==> Dependency Inversion {I don't get it}

simply put if you have an app that's tightly coupled in a business logic sense to an external API
of some sort, CRUDing your app with new features or iteration is very costly from a development
perspective

If you were a naive programmer you would think it would be best & have the least code to do this

                Ecommerce Store ====>  Stripe / Paypal API

But with the principle of Dependency inversion you would introduce some intermediary code that
would digest everything from Stripe, Paypal whoever and then use the information from those
APIs to serve the same data to your Ecommerce Store here's the diagram:

                Ecommmerce Store ====> Payment Events API <==== Stripe / Paypal API

    Example Scenario:

        1. Customer Buys    ====> 2. Buy Event Gets Sent        ====> 3. Stripe API Receives and 
            Shoes for $200        to Stripe API to get                   processes the payment 
                                  say we got a purchase     

        6. Success Event   <==== 5. Our Middleware Payments    <==== 4. Stripe API sends 
           Gets consumed and        API Reveives this and               a success event
           Customer gets a          ends a success event
           purchase confirmation    who's shape we control
                                    and is independent of
                                    payments API we use.

I get it now :) TL;DR it's middleware that's in-house artisanally engineered
====================================================================================================

3. Data ===> The data layer itself consists of a Repository implementation (the contract that comes from
             your domain layer and datat sources) where one is for remote data and the other is for local
             data. And the REPOSITORY layer decides based on let's say internet connection whether fresh
             remote data is used or stale Cached data.

             Also man plz notice that data sources don't regturn entities but MODELS. The reason behind 
             this is b/c  converting raw data like JSON into dart objects requires some code and we'd 
             rather deal with that all in one concentrated place and we don't want this to affect our
             domain entities. This is so that if the data stays the same but the source changes you
             can easily change code in one place and if your data changes you change both.

             This is why we'd create model classes that extend our entity classes and add some 
             specific functionality like JSON => Dart Object and Dart Object => JSON.


             In the case of this app RemoteDataSource will perform HTTP GET requests on the Numbers API,
             and LocalDataSource will cache data using the shared_preferences package. These two data
             sources will be comibined in the NumberTriviaRepository which will be the single source of 
             truth for the interesting number trivia data. The chaching policy will be very simple, if 
             there is an ingternet connection alwasy getthe data from the API and cacheit. If there is
             no network return the latest cache data.
